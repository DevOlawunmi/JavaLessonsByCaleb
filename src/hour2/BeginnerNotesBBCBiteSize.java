Computer programs use data types to organise different types of data in a program.
Data can also be constant or variable within programs and functions. The main purpose of computer programs is to collect and process data.
A computer can change what it does depending on the data that it has to work with.
The data that is used in a program is referred to as the data values.
These influence the sequence of instructions and the program outputs.
The key role of a computer program is to store and process data.
Any computer software has a data model that defines what data will be collected and worked on.
 The data structure defines how the flow of data is controlled in relation to inputs, processes and outputs.



PLEASE NOTE : The algorithm sets up the possibilities - it provides the set of instructions that can be executed.
 The data fed into a program controls the sequence of instructions and decides what gets executed.
